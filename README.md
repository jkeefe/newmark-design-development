Welcome to Design & Development, updated for the Fall 2019 term.

You don't need to be a developer to come up with the next big idea for a product or service that connects communities digitally, or taps a way to collect information that helps communities make decisions. But you do need basic knowledge of design and digital structure so you can work with developers and bring your idea from concept to implementation.

Plus, with a little know-how you can build functioning prototypes to help test and play with your idea -- providing an example with which you can then work with a developer to create a robust, secure and efficient product or service.

This course prepares students to work successfully with designers and developers -- from understanding fundamental design principles, to embracing programmersâ€™ unique coding culture, to having a general knowledge of various programming languages, to knowing the steps and milestones that designers and developers expect to have clearly delineated for them by their clients.

We're going to learn how to play, experiment, learn, and tinker as we toy with new ways to experience and consume information. This is a hands-on class, and participation is key. Let's have some fun and make great things -- or at least learn a lot trying.

# The Fine Print

The class description, logistics, rules, and grading details are in a document I call "[the fine print](./THE_FINE_PRINT.md)."

# The Notes

Along the way, the code and steps we'll take are outlined in [The Notes](./THE_NOTES.md).

# The Plan

Also known as the syllabus, here's the rundown of what we'll cover in our weeks together:

## How the internet works ... a review!

- Let's make sure we all understand how that information zips around
- Build a website in minutes
- Play with JavaScript in a few more
- Understand 


## Make bots to do your bidding

- Every time Donald Trump tweets, put it in a spreadsheet
- Every time it's at or below 32 degrees send a tweet
- Whenever someone posts on their blog, get an email
- Whenever papers are filed in a court case, get an email 
- Make Alexa tweet for you
- When something happens in the digital world, make something happen in the physical world

All this and more is possible without any coding at all. We'll make theses mini-products and learn about mashing up existing services into new prototypes that (maybe) never existed before.

## Valuable data is everywhere. Let's get it.

Weather info, crypto prices, earthquake alerts -- it's all available, and ready to be shaped into a new product nobody's made before you did. We'll learn how to find and use that data.

## Making quick and dirty dashboards

From web site analytics to stock prices, making dashboards to track your numbers may be the most important product you build, even if just for yourself. We'll use APIs and spreadsheets to make 'em fast.

## Roll your own information service

When your project needs to blend existing information, or relies on custom data only you have, you may need to get into some code. We'll use Glitch to play with some examples (no coding experience necessary.)

## Alexa, what's a digital assistant?

Voice interfaces are popping up everywhere, and it's possible they will be key to information acquisition in the months and years to come. We'll use Glitch to build an Alexa Skill.

## Prototyping voice conversations
 
Building a whole Alexa skill just to test it out on your friends or possible customers is possible -- but not always necessary. We'll learn how to prototype voice conversations quickly using an audio playboard.

## Storytelling with chatbots

Texting or chatting with bots is one way to communicate with your audience. We'll learn the dos and don'ts of automated conversations -- and then we'll do one.

## Say what? Computers understanding human language

Automatically processing what someone is saying -- either in a chat, to a voice assistant, or in an email -- is increasingly possible thanks to machine learning. We'll play with one of these natural language processing tools (Dialogflow) to get a handle on how to make it work for you.

## Sometimes a duck is a special duck

Can you teach a computer to recognize the Mandarin duck in Central Park. Yup. Is that useful? Could be! We'll learn how, as we see how image processing and machine learning can work together on your project.

## Lots of innovation is happening in email. Yes, email.

A good email offering may be the most important product for your project. We'll look at what makes some emails great and also how to use tools to send **useful** emails programmatically. 

## Physical products: Leaving the laptop for the tabletop

Tiny computers can sense the environment or respond to your commands. They can even keep track of things when you're far away. Prototyping these kinds of products is surprisingly cheap and easy. We'll do it in class.

## Data security: Yours, your company's, your customers'

Let's talk about security. We'll get into how you can start practicing better personal security and about how to act responsibly and ethically with the data you get from others.

## Real-world production in the cloud

When it's time for your prototype to become production-worthy, you'll need scale, security, and reliability. And chances are, that means putting it in a "cloud" service like Amazon's AWS -- or the similar offerings from Google, Microsoft, and others. We'll take a tour through AWS so you can better coordinate with your engineers when it's time to go big.

## Your project progress

Most weeks we will devote a part of class to talk about your ideas and progress on a prototyping project, and your preparation for your final presentation.
