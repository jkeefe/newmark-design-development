## What's a Prototype (for us)?

- Something you can try
- (Also something you MAKE, which is fun)
- Maybe just *one*
- Not polished
- Not at scale
- Probably not secure
- But TRY-worthy
- Something you can share

### Quick Examples

- SMS bot: Text "hi" to `(646) 699-3322`
- Better Weather

## Logistics & plan

- Go through the Syllabus.
- Everyone in the Slack! [Join here](https://socialjournalism2022.slack.com) and use your school email address. Join channel **#design-development**.

## Exploring web pages

- Sign up for [Glitch](https://glitch.com)
- Make a new project > `glitch-hello-webpage`
    - Data journalism classes: Started from scratch & uploaded to Github
    - Glitch: Start from something that already works
    - Basic layout of the page
        - Name button
            - Change the theme if you'd like
        - The files
        - A file
        - The result (which has its own URL ... which I'll call the "live site" url)
        - The share button
    - Go through `index.html`
    - Note the other files
    - Back to `README.md`
    - Click on the link where it says:
    
    ```
    Want a minimal version of this project to build your own website? Check out Blank Website!
    ```

- Much closer to blank! Just the essentials.
- Take a close look at all the files. Make sure you understand what's happening here.
- Remember that the public url first looks at `index.html`

## Assignment

_This is the "Class 1" assignment. Do it now ... it's due on at high noon before Class 2._

 Continue to play with this project in Glitch and make it your own. Change colors, play with formatting, play with the text. Get creative! Google around for html tips and tricks if you want. Post the **live link** to your project in Slack in `#design-development` so we can all try it.
