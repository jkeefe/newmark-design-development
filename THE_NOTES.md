- Maybe just *one*
- Not polished
- Not at scale
- Probably not secure
- But TRY-worthy
- Something you can share

### Quick Examples

## Exploring web pages

## Assignment

_This is the "Class 1" assignment. Do it now ... it's due on at high noon before Class 2._

Start a new `hello-webpage` project in Glitch and make it your own. Change colors, play with formatting, play with the text. Get creative! Google around for html tips and tricks if you want. Post the link to your project in Slack in `#design-development` so we can all try it.
