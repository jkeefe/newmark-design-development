# The Fine Print

Here's what you need to know to succeed in this class.

## Class Description

How to get journalism to audiences has been a challenge for decades. And with the unconventional presidency of Donald Trump, that's become an even bigger question for news organizations. Come explore what's next in news delivery and prototype your ideas. Throughout the industry, we see that the ability to build journalistic products is key, not just in startups from Vox to Quartz but also in big media companies of all sorts, from The New York Times to CNN to WNYC to a metro newspaper. This class will help you imagine and prototype new products and services -- and in the process reimagine journalism itself and how it connects with and serves the public. 

We'll develop and test your ideas using methods from paper prototyping and the latest technologies. We'll quickly see what works and what doesn't. We'll experiment with telling news stories through channels such as instant messaging, watches, intelligent agents like Siri and Alexa and even household objects. You will learn essential skills to develop, grow, test and retry how you tell stories -- and may even start a viable product. 

This laboratory is great for anyone who wants to have an edge in the changing media landscape, gain confidence in technology, learn a little code, explore ideas of their own or actually change how we consume journalism. Students will get hands-on experience with several initial prototypes and then pursue a larger project in pairs or small teams. No prior technical or coding experience required, though such skills will be helpful and welcome.

## Spirit

We're going to learn how to play, experiment, learn and tinker -- all with the goal of making new ways to experience and consume information. This is a hands-on class, and participation is key. Let's have some fun and make great things.

## Logistics

### The Schedule

We meet every Wednesday from 5:30 to 8:20 pm, including a break. Since we're at prime dinner time, feel free to bring food and drink to the extent allowed in the classroom. 

There will be assignments most weeks, usually due by noon on the day of the next class.

One of the assignments will be a detailed description of what you envision for your prototyping project. That description will be due **April 3, 2019**.

Individual project planning sessions will be scheduled for **Monday, April 8, 2019**. 

There is **no class on April 17, 2019** because I'll be off site.

There is **no class on April 24, 2019** for Spring break.

Final presentation rehearsals are **May 8, 2019** in class.

Final presentations are **May 15, 2019**. Time TBD.

### Computers in Class

Bring them! You'll use your computer in almost every class.

Be here now. Please don't email, tweet, chat or communicate with people outside the class during class. Your participation with other classmates is key. If you must take a call or a text for an urgent issue, please step out of the room.

### Slack for Communications

Let's strive for a no-email class. We'll communicate using Slack, like just about every newsroom in the United States. 

Slack is also a great platform for experimentation and prototyping, and we'll be doing some of that, too.

Our Slack is [cunylab.slack.com](https://cunylab.slack.com)

## Assignments

Most weeks will have one assignment, due to me via Slack by noon the day of our next class. Feedback on each assignment will be provided every week in class or via Slack.

## Project & Presentation

From the first day of class, you should be thinking about what you'd like to make. Maybe its an idea you get from the class discussion. Maybe it's a part of your degree project. Maybe it's a component of a project you've already started. Maybe it's just something fun you'd like to build. 

By mid term, you should have a plan in hand -- in fact, you'll have to hand it in. The latter part of the term you will be expected to work on that project on your own time, though in-class discussion and office-hours guidance will be available.

The last week of class you will present your prototyping path and show your results. Your greatest success will be secured if you _document the process_, _show your work_ and _explain your thinking_. This is not about having a finished product, it's about having a working prototype and an explanation of how you got there.

Specifically, you'll need to show:

* Your intended audience and initial goal
* Your key prototyping steps
* How you shared it with others, and the key feedback you got
* What worked, what didn't work, and changes you made
* A demo of your prototype
* Your next steps

To make this incredibly easy to pull off, I highly recommend you keep a log, diary, notebook, blog, Google document, or plain old text file that tracks your thinking along the way. Just keep a chronological document noting:

- Your latest ideas for what you'd like to try building
- The links, documents, and videos you check out along the way
- Screenshots or photos of things you tried, drew, built, saw
- Steps you took, things that worked, things that didn't
- Your changes in direction, your narrowing of focus, your flat-out failures

If you actually pull that information together every week, by the end of class the presentation will almost make itself.

## Grading

There are 100 points possible in this class.

* **Final presentation:** 30 points possible, based on the criteria set out above.
* **Attendance:** 30 points possible, 2 points for each class or planning session attended. 
* **Assignments:** 20 points possible, 2 points for awarded for each assignment completed. Incomplete or low-effort submissions will get a 1. Assignments not turned in by noon on the day of the class for which they were assigned will lose one point.
* **Participation & Progress:** 20 points possible. This will be scored based on your active participation in class and your active progress on your project. Note that absences will naturally cut into your participation score.

| Points | Grade |
| ------ | ----- |
| 97-100 |  A+ |
| 93-96 | A |
| 90-92 | A- |
| 87-89 | B+ |
| 83-86 | B |
| 80-82 | B- |
| 77-79 | C+ |
| 73-76 | C |
| 70-72 | C- |
| < 70 | F |

## Plagiarism

This is a journalism class; facts and honesty are our greatest asset. Presenting the work of others as your own is wrong and won't be tolerated. Doing so may result in a significant reduction of accumulated points and possible failure of the class.

When using code or ideas from other sources -- even free, open-sourced code -- be sure to include references and links back to that code and any applicable licenses.

If you are inspired by others, note it. It's just right.

And when working on teams, you may be asked to honestly note the specific and/or relative contributions of each teammate.
